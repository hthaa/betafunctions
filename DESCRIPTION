Description: Package providing a number of functions for working with Two- and 
    Four-parameter Beta and closely related distributions (i.e., the Gamma-
    Binomial-, and Beta-Binomial distributions). Includes d/p/q/r functions for
    Four-Parameter Beta distributions and d/p/r- functions for Beta-Binomial
    distributions. Includes moment-generating functions for Beta distributions,
    Binomial distributions, Beta-Binomial distributions, and observed value
    distributions. 
    Includes functions for estimating classification accuracy, and consistency, 
    making use of the Classical Test-Theory based 'Livingston and Lewis' (L&L) 
    and 'Hanson and Brennan' approaches. A shiny app is available, providing a 
    GUI for the L&L approach when used for binary classifications. For url to 
    the app, see documentation for the LL.CA() function.
