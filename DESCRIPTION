Description: Package providing a number of functions for working with Two- and 
    Four-parameter Beta distributions, including alternative parameterizations, 
    calculation of moments, and fitting of Beta distributions to vectors of 
    values. Also includes functions for estimating classification accuracy, 
    diagnostic performance and consistency, using what is generally known as 
    the "Livingston and Lewis approach" in the psychometric literature as the 
    foundational method, which makes extensive use of the Beta distribution.
