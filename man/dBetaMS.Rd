\title{Density Under a Specific Point of the Beta Probability Density Distribution with Specific Location Parameters, Mean, and Variance.}
\usage{
dBetaMS(x, mean, variance = NULL, sd = NULL, l = 0, u = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A specific point on the x-axis of the Standard Beta Probability Density Distribution.}

\item{mean}{The mean of the target Standard Beta probability density distribution.}

\item{variance}{The variance of the target Standard Beta probability density distribution.}

\item{sd}{The standard deviation of the target Standard Beta probability density distribution.}

\item{l}{The lower-bound location parameter. Default set to 0 (the standard Beta distribution).}

\item{u}{The upper-bound location parameter. Default set to 1 (the standard Beta distribution).}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the required value for the beta Shape-parameter in order to produce a Standard Beta probability density distribution with the target mean and variance.
}
\description{
Calculates the density under specific points of the Standard Beta probability density distribution with defined mean and variance or standard deviation.
}
\examples{
# To compute the density at a specific point (e.g., 0.5) along the Standard
# (two-parameter) Probability Density Distribution with mean of 0.6 and variance of 0.04:
dBetaMS(x = 0.5, mean = 0.6, variance = 0.04)

# To compute the density at a specific point (e.g., 50) along the four-
# parameter Beta distribution with a mean of 60, variance of 400, and lower-
# bound of 0 and upper-bound of 100:
dBetaMS(x = 50, mean = 60, variance = 400, l = 0, u = 100)
