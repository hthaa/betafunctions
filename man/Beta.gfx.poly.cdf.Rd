\title{Coordinate Generation for Marking an Area Under the Curve for the Beta Cumulative Probability Density Distribution.}
\usage{
Beta.gfx.poly.cdf(from, to, by, alpha, beta, l = 0, u = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{from}{The point of the \code{x}-axis from where to start producing \code{y}-density values.}

\item{to}{The point of the \code{x}-axis to where \code{y}-density values are to be produced.}

\item{by}{The resolution (or spacing) at which to produce \code{y}-density values.}

\item{alpha}{The Alpha shape-parameter value for the Standard Beta cumulative probability distribution.}

\item{beta}{The Beta shape-parameter fort he Standard Beta cumulative probability distribution.}

\item{l}{The lower-bound location parameter of the Beta distribution.}

\item{u}{The upper-bound location parameter of the Beta distribution.}
}
\value{
A two-column matrix with cumulative probability-values of y to plot against corresponding location values of \code{x}.
}
\description{
Plotting tool, producing a two-column matrix with values of \code{y} corresponding to locations on \code{x}. Useful for shading areas under the curve when tracing the line for the Standard Beta cumulative probability function.

\examples{
# To box in an area under a four-parameter Beta cumulative distribution with
# location parameters l = .25 and u = 75, and shape parameters
