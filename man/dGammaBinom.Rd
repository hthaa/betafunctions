\title{Generalized Binomial probability density function (Gamma-Binomial) extended to positive non-integers.}
\usage{
dGammaBinom(x, size, prob, nc = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of quantiles.}

\item{size}{Number of "trials" (zero or more). Need not be integer.}

\item{prob}{Probability of "success" on each "trial". Need not be integer.}

\item{nc}{Whether to include a normalizing constant making sure that the sum of the distribution's density is 1.}
}
\description{
Generalized Binomial probability density function (Gamma-Binomial) extended to positive non-integers.
}
\examples{
#' # Assume some variable follows a Gamma-Binomial distribution with
# "number of trials" = 10.5 and probability of "success" for each "trial"
# = 0.75, to compute the probability density to attain a "number of success"
# at a specific point (e.g., 7.5 "successes"):
dGammaBinom(x = 7.5, size = 10.5, prob = 0.75)

# Including a normalizing constant:
dGammaBinom(x = 7.5, size = 10.5, prob = 0.75, nc = TRUE)
