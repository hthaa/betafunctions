\title{Probability of Some Specific Observation under the Standard Beta PDD with Specific Mean and Variance.}
\usage{
pBetaMS(q, mean, variance = NULL, sd = NULL, lower.tail = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{A specific point on the x-axis of the Standard Beta probability density distribution with a defined mean and variance.}

\item{mean}{The mean of the target Standard Beta probability density distribution.}

\item{variance}{The variance of the target Standard Beta probability density distribution.}

\item{sd}{The standard deviation of the target Standard Beta probability density distribution.}

\item{lower.tail}{Whether the density that should be considered is between the lower-end (i.e., [0 -> x]) or the higher-end of the distribution (i.e., [x -> 1]).}
}
\value{
A value representing the probability of a random draw from the Standard Beta probability density distribution with a defined mean and variance being from one of two defined intervals (i.e., [0 -> x] or [x -> 1]).
}
\description{
Calculates the probability of some specific observation falling under a specified interval  ([0, x] or [x, 1]) under the Standard Beta probability density distribution with defined mean and variance or standard deviation.
}
\examples{
# To compute the proportion of the density under the lower-end tail of a
# point along the Standard (two-parameter) PDD (e.g., 0.5) with mean of 0.6
# and variance of 0.04:
pBetaMS(q = 0.5, mean = 0.6, variance = 0.04)
