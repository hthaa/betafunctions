\title{Probability of Some Specific Observation under the Beta Probability Density Distribution with Specific Location Parameters, Mean, and Variance.}
\usage{
pBetaMS(q, mean, variance = NULL, sd = NULL, lower.tail = TRUE, l = 0, u = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{A specific point on the x-axis of the Standard Beta probability density distribution with a defined mean and variance.}

\item{mean}{The mean of the target Standard Beta probability density distribution.}

\item{variance}{The variance of the target Standard Beta probability density distribution.}

\item{sd}{The standard deviation of the target Standard Beta probability density distribution.}

\item{lower.tail}{Whether the density that should be considered is between the lower-end (i.e., [0 -> x]) or the higher-end of the distribution (i.e., [x -> 1]).}

\item{l}{The lower-bound location parameter. Default set to 0 (the standard Beta distribution).}

\item{u}{The upper-bound location parameter. Default set to 1 (the standard Beta distribution).}
}
\value{
A value representing the probability of a random draw from the Standard Beta probability density distribution with a defined mean and variance being from one of two defined intervals (i.e., [0 -> x] or [x -> 1]).
}
\description{
Calculates the probability of some specific observation falling under a specified interval  ([0, x] or [x, 1]) under the Standard Beta probability density distribution with defined mean and variance or standard deviation.
}
\examples{
# To compute the proportion of the density under the lower-end tail of a
# point along the Standard (two-parameter) Probability Density Distribution
# (e.g., 0.5) with mean of 0.6 and variance of 0.04:
pBetaMS(q = 0.5, mean = 0.6, variance = 0.04)

# To compute the proportion of the density under the lower-end tail of a
# point along the Four-Parameter Beta Probability Density Distribution
# (e.g., 50) with mean of 60 and variance of 400, and lower-bound of 0 and
# upper-bound of 100:
pBetaMS(q = 50, mean = 60, variance = 400, l = 0, u = 100)
